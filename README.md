The app development skill you’ll be learning is one of Apple’s frameworks: Core Data. It’s responsible for managing objects in a database, including reading, writing, filtering, sorting, and more, and it’s hugely important in all app development for iOS, macOS, and beyond.

Canadian software developer Rob Pike – creator of the Go programming language, member of the team that developed Unix, co-creator of UTF-8, and also published author – wrote this about data:

“Data dominates. If you've chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.”

This is often shortened to “write stupid code that uses smart objects,” and as you’ll see objects don’t get much smarter than when they are backed by Core Data!
